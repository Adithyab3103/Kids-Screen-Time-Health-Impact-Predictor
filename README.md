Kids Screen Time Health Impact Predictor
A cloud-based machine learning solution for predicting the potential health impacts of screen time on children, deployed on AWS ECS/ECR. The system features an ensemble model (XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost) with explainable AI capabilities, containerized using Docker for seamless deployment. The web interface, built with Streamlit, allows parents and caregivers to input children's screen time patterns and receive real-time predictions about potential health impacts with detailed explanations.
